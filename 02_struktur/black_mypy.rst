### Exercise 4: Type annotations

Add type annotations to the function arguments and return values.
Also add type annotations for the most important variables.

Re-run the code and make sure it still works.

*Does the program also work if you deliberately use a **wrong** type?

#### Exercise 5: Type checker

Install a Python type checker with

    pip install mypy

Then check the types with 

    mypy twenty_questions.py

### Exercise 6: Code linter

Clean up the code by running:

    black twenty_questions.py
